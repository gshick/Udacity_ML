    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve.

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "For the three models that I chose, the random forest model seems to have the best performance on the training set, having both the highest accuracy and F Score.  However, on the testing data, the Gradient Boosting Classifier outperforms the Random Forest Classifier, indicating that the Random Forest model may be overfitting in the training data.  The SVC model is likely the worst model, as it had the lowest accuracy and F Score for both the testing and training data, as well as the highest prediction/training time.  Out of these three models, the Gradient Boosting Classifier appears to be the best choice for CharityML, however because it's accuracy score in the testing data is about 85% while the F Score is about 75%, it may be worth exploring additional options outside of these three models, such as ADA Boost or Naive Bayes to validate if any additional accuracy may be gained through a different approach."

    "The gradient boosting model starts from taking our data and trying to find a single, linear line that best fits our data.  We determine which line fits best based on minimizing error, or the distance between each point and our line.  After we determine which line fits best, we then starting splitting the single line into multiple connected lines (or trees) that provide a better representation of our data.  We continue this process until we achieve the maximum accuracy (i.e. minimizing error) for our model.  Another way to think about the approach is via traveling down a trail.  We all know the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, but what if that path includes altitude gain or difficult obstacles?  In that case, we would choose a new path at each inflection point to minimize our effort (or error) in following the trail.

Because the optimized model results are lower than the unoptimized model, this may indicate that we should further evaluate additional models (such as ADA boost) to see if accuracy/F-Score can be further improved. However, both the optimized and unoptimized models are far superior to the Naïve Bayes model from question 1."

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "Native country appears to be one of the top predictors of income over \\\\$50k, with 23\\% of U.S. born census respondents making over $50k.  This makes intuitive sense as CharityML is U.S. based and targeting people living in California.  However, just because this is a good predictor of income, does not mean that CharityML would want to target based on this population, As California is a diverse state and may not be in CharityML's best interest to target on this feature alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2) marital-status:__\n",
    "\n",
    "Marital status also appears to be a top driver of income over \\\\$50k, with 21\\% of respondents who are 'married-civ-spouse' making over $50k.  This is likely due to the increased household income that comes from having the possibility of two working adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "__3) relationship:__\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to marital status, having a relationship of 'husband' or 'wife' related to 21\\% of respondents having income over \\\\$50k.  However, there could be strong overlap with the marital-status feature, so CharityML should consider any issues with multicollinearity between these two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "__4) education_level:__\n",
    "\n",
    "Those with high school diplomas and above over-index in the >$50k category, because finishing high-school is highly correlated with higher lifetime earnings, and in general the more education that you complete (Bachelors, Masters, Doctorate and hopefully Udacity nanodegrees) also equate to higher average annual income.\n",
    "\n",
    "__5) workclass:__\n",
    "\n",
    "Private sector and self-employed individuals generally seem to have a higher proportion on census respondents with incomes over >\\\\$50k, likely because private-sector jobs generally pay higher than government jobs, either at the state or federal level.  This may be an interesting segment for CharityML to target.\n",

    "Race/Gender also seem to correlate with earnings over $50k, though I would find it problematic to target donors based on those factors, unless the charity was somehow tied to a specific demographic.  Please see below for frequency tables used in this analysis."

    "Interestingly, only one of the features I highlighted was found to be of high importance, albeit indirectly.  I chose education-level, which is highly related to education-num, though not exactly the same.  I did not consider age or capital-loss, but when I examined capital-gain and hours-per-week, I did not find a strong indication that they would be highly important to the model.  That being said, this further demonstrates the importance of using a feature importance calculation, instead of just a frequency distribution, as continuous variables may be hard to track.  I initially thought capital-gains would be a highly important feature, though that was not confirmed by my frequency table.  This may be because I need to analyze the amounts lost/gained instead of just the frequency.  I would be interested to further evaluate the variables for multicolineariarty, as capital-gains/losses could be highly related, as would age and education."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
